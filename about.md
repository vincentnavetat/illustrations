I am a self-taught illustrator based in London.

I mostly work with ink and watercolour painting, with light usage of computer editing.

My favourite subjects are people, animals, cities and plant. I aim at building wordless stories, conveying a positive, naive and playful atmosphere.

If you have any question or enquiry, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:vincentnavetat@gmail.com).
