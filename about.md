I am a self-taught illustrator based in London.

I mostly work with ink and watercolour painting, alongside light computer editing.

My favourite subjects are people, animals, cities and plants. I like to build wordless stories, conveying a playful, positive and naive atmosphere.

If you have any question or enquiry, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:vincentnavetat@gmail.com)!
